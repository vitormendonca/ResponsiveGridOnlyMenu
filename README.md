# ResponsiveGridOnlyMenu
Simple and Complete "Hamburguer" Menu.
On javascript I made a simple Hide/Show with the icon, adding a new row or removing when navigation is hidden.
All css is display grid default. Only used inline-block on <a> Tag to make it the size of the <li> Tag for smalldevices.
As I am a beginner, the code can be improved.
